# SpringProject
I'm using REST consumptions asynch annotations and also JPA

This project is using Tomcat 9.0 server and maven repository

To consume it in postman via POST request you can use the following url:
	localhost:8080/loreTest/hola/mundo

The JSON shouls be as follows:

	{
		"nombre":"lore",
		"edad":27
	}
